# fall-detection
Complete machine learning project. The goal is to analyze and manipulate data from an accelerometer to predict fall detection.

Assign3_Fall_Detection_AC0_92.ipynb = Completed a project testing three machine learning models (SVM, XGBoost, and Random Forest) to predict falls based on data from an accelerometer, magnetometer, and gyroscope. Dataset available on: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kWQ68gd-Y9OY-C94zTJHxXOqKMqvIjMU/view?usp=sharing]. Best Score, F1 = 0.94 on Random Forest.
Project based on the follow paper: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V5r5ECJSfpophu1hwlauZBV1v08N3VII/view
